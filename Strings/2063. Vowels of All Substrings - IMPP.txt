2063. Vowels of All Substrings


Theme is to find out the no of vowels in each substring formed from each element, 

Logic:::: The logic is that the char will be present in the all the substrings formed by the elements before it and all the substrings formed by it

	(i+1) * (n-i)

	-(i+1) all the chars including it before.
	-(n-i) the remaining chars that can be used and form the substrings


class Solution {
public:
    long long countVowels(string word) {
        
        // we camn do it in DP and recursive way.

        // The efficient optimised way is that. 
        // 1.the char will be present in all the substrings that start from it
        // 2. char will present in all the substrings end by it.
        // e is in middle present in the substrings present before and after
